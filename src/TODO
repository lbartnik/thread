What's next?

There seems to be a problem with synchronization:
  - either PROTECT/UNPROTECT need to happen with a wrapper that maks
    sure we are accessing the correct R_PPStack
  - or R_PPStack* variables need to be turned into pointers to the
    current chained_stack object; this will simplify synchronization
    on entering and leaving GIL greatly
