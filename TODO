* see how exactly contexts are defined in main/context.c
  maybe they should be traced as well in order to correctly catch
  exceptions in threads

* add memory allocation callback

* add facility to run C functions in a GIL-free context; this
  requires synchronized allocation and probably additional logic
  to handle exceptions and jumps with thread's stack

* where are warnings stored? what other data needs to be accounted
  for per thread?

* most probably also PROTECT() and all kinds of UNPROTECT() need to
  be synchronized; what's the code behind them? how much bookkeeping
  is required?
